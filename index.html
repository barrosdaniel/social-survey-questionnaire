        <h2 class="content-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The availability of quality education has been a challenge to many
            communities around the globe. (Bokova) This is even more so in
            specialised professional fields, such as Computer Science and
            Software Engineering. (Sentance, 2021)</p>
        <p>It is hypothesised that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large
            Language Model (LLM) tools may be part of the solution in bridging
            gaps in the availability, costs and logistics of Education when
            combined with online learning modals. (Callum, 2020)</p>
        <p>In the last few months, a lot has been published about the role of AI
            and LLM tools in the Software Development professional experience.
            However, it seems that the number of scientific and empirical
            studies attempting to identify the impact of these tools in the
            experience of Computer Science and Software Engineering students has
            been limited. This is a missed opportunity as some academics argue
            that incorporating these tools into Computer Science Education is
            inevitable. The most important question is not whether to integrate
            them, but how to integrate these tools in a way that promotes
            effective learning and their ethical use. (Hazzan, 2023)</p>
        <p>This survey project is aimed at evaluating the effects of AI tools on
            the learning experience of Computer Science and Software Engineering
            students. The insights gathered in this survey may be used to guide
            future advancements in educational technologies and pedagogical
            approaches.</p>
